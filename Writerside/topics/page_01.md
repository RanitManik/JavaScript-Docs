# Writing and Running Code

## 1. Giving Instructions to a Computer

JavaScript serves as a versatile programming language, empowering developers to command computers and create dynamic,
interactive web pages. Functioning as a client-side scripting language, JavaScript enhances user experiences by
modifying HTML and CSS content and behavior.

## 2. Writing JavaScript Code

JavaScript code can be seamlessly integrated into HTML documents or stored in separate files. The language supports both
procedural and object-oriented programming, enabling tasks like calculations, data manipulation, and responding to user
interactions. Let's explore a basic example:

```javascript
// JavaScript code to display a message
var greeting = "Hello, JavaScript!";
console.log(greeting);
```

In this snippet, a variable `greeting` is declared, assigned a string, and then the message is logged to the console
using `console.log()`.

## 3. Running Our Code Using the Console

The browser console, accessible through developer tools, facilitates testing and debugging. Open it (usually with `F12`
or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"), navigate to the "Console" tab, and input JavaScript code directly.

For instance, copy the previous code into the console and press `Enter` to view the output. The console aids in variable
inspection, error identification, and understanding code execution.

## 4. Syntax

JavaScript syntax establishes rules for proper code interpretation. Essential syntax elements include:

- **Variables:**
  ```javascript
  var x = 10;
  ```

- **Functions:**
  ```javascript
  function addNumbers(a, b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```

- **Conditional Statements:**
  ```javascript
  if (x > 5) {
      console.log("x is greater than 5");
  } else {
      console.log("x is not greater than 5");
  }
  ```

- **Loops:**
  ```javascript
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
  }
  ```

Mastering syntax is crucial for crafting effective JavaScript code. Regular practice and exploration will enhance
proficiency.
